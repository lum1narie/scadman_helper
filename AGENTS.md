# AI Agent Context: truncate_cmd_rs

## Project Overview

TODO:

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Rust
- **Environment Management:** Nix Flakes
- **Version Control:** jj-vcs with git backend

## Code Rule

- Documentation
  - Include Arguments, Returns, and Exceptions in function documentation,
    if they exist.
    - Also describe any unpredictable behavior
      that may arise from the overview.
  - Don't write too many. Keep simple and clear.
- Strive to keep every line of code and documentation within 80
  characters whenever possible. If allowed by context or grammar, use
  line breaks to meet the character limit.
  But no need to check strictly with tool. I will run foramtter after your edit.

## AI Chat Rule

- The AI must respond in the same language as the user's prompt.
- When a change is large enough that it requires edits in two or more locations,
  or involves more than 80 lines of changes, follow this protocol:
  1. Read the relevant input files first.
  2. Before making any file changes, ask me any necessary questions.
  3. Do not begin producing output or applying changes until you have received my answers.
  - Exceptions and constraints:
    - If you are completely certain that every required condition is already clear and no questions are needed, explicitly tell me “There is nothing to ask,” and then proceed.
    - Ask at most 5 questions.
    - Ask as few questions as possible.

## Development Environment

The development environment is fully managed by Nix to ensure
reproducibility.

1. **Setup:** Run `nix develop` in the project root. This command will
   install all necessary dependencies, including Python and the
   required packages, into a temporary shell.
1. **Execution:** All development commands, including running the
   script, should be executed within this shell.

## Key Files

- `flake.nix`: Manages the Nix environment and provides development commands.
- `src/main.rs`: Main application entry point.

## Development Workflow

- **Build**
  - `nix build`: Release build
- **Running the script:**
  - `nix run .#defualt`: Run the binary

### Development AI Rule

- Testing
  - Add test in `./tests` diretctories if you make new function.
  - Never change the things already exists in `./tests`.
    - Only unless the function specification change is directly
      requested in the prompt.
- Language
  - Write comments and documentations in **English**.
- Document
  - If you make changes that affect users, **update `README.md`**.
  - If you define new types or functions, write documentation.
- VCS
  - Never try to run the `jj` or `git` command unless the user directly,
    or nix flake requests the execution of a git command in the prompt.
    (Some commands of it will not work in dirty status.)
  - You are not required to generate a commit message unless the
    user directly requests it.
  - When requested to think about git commit messages, if the
    current staged content contains multiple contexts, please also
    suggest how to split them.
    - However, if there are both staged and unstaged changes
      within the same file, there is no need to split them.

### Testing and Linting

- **Test**
  - `nix flake check`: Test everything
    - format
    - lint

#### Runtime Arguments Rules

TODO:

## Commit Rule

- This project uses jj.
- This project uses gitflow.
- This project uses gitmoji.
- Commit message must be in English.
- Commit title format: `<type>: <emoji>(<context>) <body>`
  (e.g., 'refactor: :recycle:(backend) split `calc_fraction()` into
  multiple functions')
  - Select one of emoji from the list below apppropriate to show
    context of the commit.
    - Refer `kind` of emoji.
  - `<type>`: Commit type (e.g., fix, feat, docs). `type` column in
    the table.
    - Must match one of the IDs from the emoji list.
  - `<emoji>`: The emoji, `emoji` column in the table, written as a
    string enclosed in double colons (e.g., `:bug:`, `:sparkles:`,
    `:books:`, `:rocket:`), NOT as a Unicode emoji.
    - When writing the emoji. always use the double colon notation
      (e.g., `:sparkles:`), not the Unicode emoji symbol.
      - For instance, write `:sparkles:` instead of ✨.
  - `<context>`: The context of the commit, representing an
    externally visible unit, such as a module or issue number (e.g.,
    `main`, `reader`, `fix: #1234`, `docs: #1234`).
    - `(<context>)` is optional, including the parentheses.
    - Avoid using code-specific units like function names or class
      names as context.
    - If the change type is broad or affects multiple areas, omit
      the context.
  - `<body>`: The description of commit.
    (e.g. `add function to calculate the length of meridian line`)
- Optionally, include a commit body for:
  - Details on what was changed.
  - Explanation of why the change was made.
- If you make commit body, please separate it from the title with line
  break.

- Use universally understandable abbreviations.
- Keep titles under 80 characters, ideally under 50 unless necessary.
- Limit the body to 300 characters (5 lines).
  - Each line is under 80 characters.
  - Each paragraph is separated by a blank line.
  - Without counting the blank lines.

### gitmojis

The meaning of row:

- `type`, `emoji`: as above
- `description`: The description of emoji.
- `kind`: The category of emoji.
- `utf8`: emoji in utf8 format.
